            Durga Puja is a major Hindu festival that is celebrated in India and Bangladesh with great enthusiasm and devotion. The festival is celebrated in honor of the goddess Durga, who is considered to be the mother of the universe and the embodiment of power and strength. Durga Puja is celebrated during the Hindu month of Ashwin, which typically falls between September and October in the Gregorian calendar.

            The festival of Durga Puja is celebrated for ten days, with the main celebrations taking place on the last five days. During these five days, elaborate rituals and ceremonies are performed in temples and homes to invoke the blessings of the goddess. One of the main attractions of the festival is the creation of large, colorful and intricate idols of the goddess, which are placed in pandals (temporary structures) for the public to view and worship.

                The first day of Durga Puja is known as Mahalaya, which marks the beginning of the festival and the arrival of the goddess on earth. On this day, devotees wake up early in the morning and take a dip in holy rivers or lakes to purify themselves. They then perform various rituals and offer prayers to the goddess.
